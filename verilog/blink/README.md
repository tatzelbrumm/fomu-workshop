# Minimal Verilog Example

A minimal Verilog example which simply blinks the RGB LEDs at different
frequencies.

Unlike the example in ../blink-expanded, it **only** builds on Linux
(but contains a commented Makefile).

## Using

Type `make` to build the DFU image.
Type `make load` to load the DFU image onto the Fomu board.
Type `make clean` to remove all the generated files.
